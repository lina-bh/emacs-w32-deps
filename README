build system for cross compiling gnutls and gzip for emacs on windows.
the objective is to produce the smallest possible emacs in terms of code
size that can open org files and download packages, so that it can fit inside
the tiny network drive quota at uni.

install a newish python3, curl, and a mingw-w64 toolchain. add dependencies in
sources. run download.py and make. you should have gnutls, nettle and gzip
stripped in dlls/. copy them into your emacs build's bin/ directory.

on the TODO list:
* making everything run on windows.
so far the technique is to build this on my mac and emacs inside a windows
virtual machine, then combine the two afterwards.
* libXpm-nox, otherwise the toolbar buttons are in b&w.
* libxml2
* cutting out some of the rarely used lisp

i don't use the sqlite integration as of yet. jansson and zlib fall back to
json.el and gzip. image libraries aren't necessary as you can use emacs' support
for GDI+. gmp is replaced with mini-gmp in gnutls and you can do the same with
emacs. tree-sitter and native comp are non starters because you need to haul a c
compiler around.

do what the fuck you want with this software but don't ask me for shit. see
LICENCE.
